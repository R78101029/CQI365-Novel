# Consistency Check Report: Chapters 00-02

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Scope:** Chapters 1.00, 1.01, 1.02 vs. `_world`, `_meta`, `_characters`

## 1. Summary
- **Overall Status:** ✅ **PASS** (with one minor meta-data correction needed)
- **Character Voice:** Consistent with `character_master.md`.
- **Timeline:** Consistent with `timeline_master.md`.
- **World Building:** Consistent with `glossary.md` and `world_bible.md`.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### ✅ Chapter 1.00: Prologue (2026-03)
- **Consistency:**
    - Chen Yu (33) and Lin Yanting (38) ages match.
    - TAP/IDP prototyping phase aligns with `glossary.md`.
    - Relationship dynamics (Lin as mentor/check, Chen as visionary) align with profiles.

### ✅ Chapter 1.01: Optimization (2027-09)
- **Consistency:**
    - Sets up the "Benevolence Paradox" theme correctly.
    - Mentions "Taipei Smart Streetlights" pilot, which `world_bible.md` identifies as the "2027 Pilot Conflict".
    - Tone matches the "Techno-Thriller" genre.

### ✅ Chapter 1.02: The Paper (2028-04)
- **Consistency:**
    - Elena (31) age matches.
    - "The Benevolence Paradox" paper content perfectly matches the definition in `glossary.md`.
    - CIA funding plot point aligns with `glossary.md` entry for "CIA AI Threat Assessment Group".
    - Seamlessly bridges the gap between the 2027 pilot and the growing 2028 tensions.

## 3. ⚠️ Discrepancy Found (Meta-Data Only)

**Issue:** Version mismatch regarding the "Taipei Pilot Conflict" chapter number.
- **`world_bible.md` (Section 5):** Lists "2027 Taipei Pilot Conflict" as **(1.03)**.
- **`chapter_order.md` (v3.0):** Lists **1.03** as "Book1_Chap03_Blind_Spot.md" (Taipei MRT Disaster) in **2028-09**.
- **Analysis:** `chapter_order.md` v3.0 is the authority. The "2027 Pilot Conflict" is discussed in **1.01** (Optimization) as a background event/ongoing pilot, rather than being a standalone active chapter in the current structure.

**Recommendation:**
- Update `world_bible.md` to remove the specific chapter reference "(1.03)" for the 2027 event, or change it to refer to the 2026-2027 period covered by active context.
- Proceed with writing Chapter 1.03 (Blind Spot) as planned in `chapter_order.md`.

## 4. Conclusion
The first three chapters are solidified. The narrative arc from "Development (1.00)" to "Discovery of Flaw (1.01)" to "Theoretical Escalation (1.02)" is logical and consistent. We are ready to move to the "Real World Consequence (1.03)" phase.
