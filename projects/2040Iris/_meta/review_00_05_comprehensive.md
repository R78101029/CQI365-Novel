**Scope:** Narrative consistency, Character Arcs, World-building logic.

## 1. Executive Summary
The first act of *2040Iris* (Book I, Part 1 & start of Part 2) is logically sound and emotionally resonant. The transition from "Technological Optimism" to "Real-world Tragedy" has been successfully executed with the timeline fix in Chapter 1.04.

| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timeline** | ✅ Fixed | 1.04 moved to Jan 2029. Sequence is now causal and linear. |
| **Characters** | ✅ Strong | Marcus and Lin are serving as perfect foils. Chen Yu is positioned for his fall. |
| **Themes** | ✅ Clear | "Transparency vs Efficiency" and "Benevolence Paradox" are well-defined. |

## 2. Chapter-by-Chapter Consistency Check

| Chap | Date | Key Event | Consistency Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.00** | 2026-03 | **Origin**: Chen Yu & Lin define "Intent". | **Pass**. Sets up the "Transparency" promise that fails later. |
| **1.01** | 2027 | **Optimization**: Lin sees the "Bubble". | **Pass**. Foreshadows Lin's cynicism and daughter's role (aged 5). |
| **1.02** | 2028-04 | **Paradox**: Elena defines the problem. | **Pass**. Elena's theory (Benevolence Paradox) is exactly what Marcus practices in 1.05. |
| **1.03** | 2028-09 | **Hubris**: Chen Yu's manual fix. | **Pass**. Establishes Chen Yu's competence but also his reliance on "manual control". |
| **1.04** | 2029-01 | **Fracture**: The Factions split. | **Pass (Fixed)**. The Stanford Summit now correctly precedes the 1.05 trial. |
| **1.05** | 2029-03 | **Consequence**: Marcus's Trolley Problem. | **Pass**. The "11 vs 1" logic follows directly from PROMETHEUS philosophy. |

## 3. World-Building & Details Audit

### ✅ Confirmed Alignments
1.  **Lin's Daughter (Lin Xiaoxia)**:
    - Age 5 in 2027 (1.01).
    - Age 7 in 2029.
    - **Status**: Correct. She is 7 during the upcoming catastrophe (1.07/1.08), making her vulnerability acute.
2.  **Su Wei**:
    - Introduced in 1.03 as an aggressive reporter.
    - **Status**: Correct. She is positioned to be the one who exposes Elena in 1.06.
3.  **Marcus's Backstory**:
    - Chapter 1.05 adds that his mother died of **opioid addiction (painkillers)** in 2025.
    - **Analysis**: This is a *great* addition. It explains why he hates "short-term comfort" (painkillers) and prefers "long-term survival". It makes his cruelty in 1.05 deeply personal, not just mathematical.

### ⚠️ Minor Watch-outs (For Future)
1.  **Elena's CIA Funding**:
    - We need to ensure the *reveal* in 1.06 feels earned. Hints were dropped in 1.02 (her expensive lab equipment?), but 1.06 needs to hit hard.
2.  **Chen Yu's " GACA Backdoor"**:
    - He will sign the GACA agreement in 1.12 (Dec 2029).
    - **Suggestion**: In 1.08 (Singapore), Chen Yu should *fail* to solve the problem manually (unlike 1.03), forcing him to realize he needs a system (GACA/IRIS). The contrast between 1.03 (Success) and 1.08 (Failure) is crucial.

## 4. Suggestions for Next Steps

### Immediate Action (Chapter 1.06)
- **Title**: *Public Outcry (真相的背叛)*
- **Focus**: Su Wei exposes Elena.
- **Goal**: Destroy the "Center" (Elena/Academia). With the Center gone, the world is forced to choose sides (Marcus vs K).
- **Note**: This chapter must break the friendship between Su Wei and Elena permanently (until Book II).

### Strategic Suggestion: "The Slide into 1.07"
- We are approaching **Black Friday (1.07)**.
- **Suggestion**: Use 1.06 to not just expose Elena, but to show **social unrest**. The "Mother's Choice" verdict (1.05) should drastically increase public distrust in AI.
- **Result**: By 1.07, the public should be *scared* and *angry*, making the crash feel like a spark in a powder keg.

**Conclusion**: The foundation is solid. No major rewrites needed. Proceed to Chapter 1.06.
